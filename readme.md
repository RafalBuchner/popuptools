# Pop Up Tools

This extension provides commonly used tools that pop up in the glyph editor when you need them.

Tool                 | Hot Key
---------------------|----------
Align and Distribute | control-a
Boolean Operations   | control-o
Transform            | control-t

These try to be smart about doing stuff only to what you have selected.
